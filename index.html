The incantation of Yanling in Purification Rituals can break curses by calming vengeful spirits and providing guidance to lost souls. This Ritual takes about half an hour to complete and it may be performed by two to four people.</h2>

          <p class="text-white-50">The Western region of Hunan is filled with beautiful rolling mountains and there are many complex cave systems all over them. The Fallen Flower Cave is the biggest cave amongst all. According to the legends, this is a strange and mysterious place where the barrier between the worlds are frayed. Local residents believe that a powerful spirit dwells within the cave, who strikes every year to abduct the souls of young maidens in the area, making them slip into madness and eventually die of hysteria. The local women are encouraged to remain indoors after dark and to avoid the cave at all times.</p>
<p class="text-white-50">A few days ago, the Zhu family - greatly respected in the village by most - have vanished without a trace. It is rumoured that they have been cursed by Gu Magic and their eldest daughter was chosen as “The Maiden of Fallen Flower Cave”. This strange disappearance has caused quite a stir among the locals, who believes that the curse is spreading..</p>

              <p  class="text-black-50 text-left">The youngest child of the Yan Family, a wealthy family of land developers which capitalised on the rapid urbanisation of rural China. Recently they have set their eyes on an undeveloped piece of mountainous land in Hunan, despite the local dissent that this act will bring great misfortune.
</p>
  <p  class="text-black-50 text-left">Yongchun feels guilty about her background and couldn’t care less about inheriting the family business - all she wanted was to be a professional fighter. She loved the adrenaline rush of overcoming tough challenges and hated the idea of having to deal with sociopathic businessmen in formal clothes. </p>
  <p  class="text-black-50 text-left">Throughout much of her life, Yongchun has trained in various Neijia martial arts - a Chinese practice which utilises the "Power Word" Qi principle to overcome opponents. Yongchun participated in many martial arts competitions as a child and continues the discipline into adulthood, much to the dismay of her parents. In the fighting cage, people often underestimate her because of her small stature and end up paying a heavy price for it.  This fierce young woman is quickly becoming a rising star in the underground fight club scene.

Unknown to many, Luo possesses an uncontrollable power of retrognition. When she touches something, she triggers a flashback of memories or sensations which allows her to experience what has happened to it in the past. She used her skills to help bring some of the most infamous murderers to trial.</p>
<p  class="text-black-50 text-left">However, it has been difficult for her to cope with heightened extrasensory perception - experiencing violent flashbacks every single day has taken a toll on her wellbeing, but her hatred of injustice and her instinct to protect the vulnerable overwhelms everything in life.</p>
<p  class="text-black-50 text-left">Recently, Luo has been pulled into a series of strange incidents associated with the House of Zhu. The large family have vanished without a trace, and the local residents are reluctant to give information. They believe that the Zhu family have angered the “Spirit of the Cave”...</p>
